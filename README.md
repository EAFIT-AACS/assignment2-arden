## Assignment Overview
This repository contains our submission for Assignment 2 of Formal Languages. The assignment is based on the context-free grammar:

S -> aSb | ε

We have implemented three distinct algorithms:

1. **Algorithm 1:**  
   - **Purpose:** Generate strings that belong to the language (accepted) and strings that do not belong (rejected) but use the same alphabet \(\{a, b\}\).
   - **Details:**  
     - Accepted strings follow the pattern \( a^n b^n \) (e.g., "", "ab", "aabb", "aaabbb").
     - Rejected strings are examples that do not meet this pattern.
   - **File:** `ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2025_JJE.py`

2. **Algorithm 2:**  
   - **Purpose:** Implement a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) that recognizes strings generated by grammar \(G\).  
   - **Details:**  
     - The PDA pushes a marker for every 'a' and pops for every 'b'.
     - The algorithm processes the input symbol by symbol and logs a detailed history of configurations (position, current symbol, and stack contents).
     - This history is useful for debugging and for constructing derivation trees later.
   - **File:** `ALGORITHM_2_LFCO_2025_JJE.py`

3. **Algorithm 3:**  
   - **Purpose:** Build a leftmost derivation tree (or list of sentential forms) for accepted strings by the grammar \(G\).
   - **Details:**  
     - For any accepted string of the form \(a^n b^n\), the derivation is constructed starting from the start symbol \(S\) and repeatedly applying the production \(S \rightarrow a \, S \, b\) until \(S\) is replaced by \(\varepsilon\).
     - The output is printed with increasing indentation to clearly display the derivation process.
   - **File:** `ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2025_JJE.py`
  
## Detailed Implementation Overview

### Algorithm 1: String Generation
- *Functions:*
  - generate_accepted_strings(): Generates strings of the form \(a^n b^n\) for several values of \(n\).
  - generate_rejected_strings(): Provides sample strings that do not conform to the pattern \(a^n b^n\).
- *Main Function:*  
  Displays both the accepted and rejected strings.

### Algorithm 2: PDA Simulation
- *Functions:*
  - run_pda(input_string): Simulates the PDA for the language \(\{a^n b^n\}\). It handles each symbol, updates the stack accordingly, and logs every configuration.
- *Main Function:*  
  Tests the PDA on a set of strings, prints whether each string is accepted or rejected, and displays the configuration history.

### Algorithm 3: Leftmost Derivation Tree
- *Functions:*
  - leftmost_derivation(string): Constructs the leftmost derivation for an input string using the grammar \(G\).
  - print_derivation_tree(derivation): Prints the derivation steps with increasing indentation for clarity.
- *Main Function:*  
  Processes a set of test strings, printing the derivation tree for those accepted by the grammar.
