## Assignment Overview
This repository contains our submission for Assignment 2 of Formal Languages. The assignment is based on the context-free grammar:

S -> aSb | ε

We have implemented three distinct algorithms:

1. **Algorithm 1:**  
   - **Purpose:** Generate strings that belong to the language (accepted) and strings that do not belong (rejected) but use the same alphabet {a, b}.
   - **Details:**  
     - Accepted strings follow the pattern **aⁿbⁿ** (e.g., "", "ab", "aabb", "aaabbb").
     - Rejected strings are examples that do not meet this pattern.
   - **File:** `ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2025_JJE.py`

2. **Algorithm 2:**  
   - **Purpose:** Implement a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) that recognizes strings generated by grammar G.  
   - **Details:**  
     - The PDA pushes a marker for every 'a' and pops for every 'b'.
     - The algorithm processes the input symbol by symbol and logs a detailed history of configurations (position, current symbol, and stack contents).
     - This history is useful for debugging and for constructing derivation trees later.
   - **File:** `ALGORITHM_2_LFCO_2025_JJE.py`

3. **Algorithm 3:**  
   - **Purpose:** Build a leftmost derivation tree (or list of sentential forms) for accepted strings by the grammar G.
   - **Details:**  
     - For any accepted string of the form **aⁿbⁿ**, the derivation is constructed starting from the start symbol S and repeatedly applying the production S -> aSb until S is replaced by ε.
     - The output is printed with increasing indentation to clearly display the derivation process.
   - **File:** `ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2025_JJE.py`
  
## Detailed Implementation Overview

### Algorithm 1: String Generation
- *Functions:*
  - generate_accepted_strings(): Generates strings of the form **aⁿbⁿ** for several values of n.
  - generate_rejected_strings(): Provides sample strings that do not conform to the pattern **aⁿbⁿ**.
- *Main Function:*  
  Displays both the accepted and rejected strings and save them in a file called "generated_strings.txt"

### Algorithm 2: PDA Simulation
- *Functions:*
  - run_pda(input_string): Simulates the PDA for the language **aⁿbⁿ**. It handles each symbol, updates the stack accordingly, and logs every configuration.
- *Main Function:*  
  Tests the PDA with the generated_strings.txt file created in the previous Algorithm, prints whether each string is accepted or rejected, displays the configuration history and save the accepted strings in a file called "accepted_strings.txt" to be used in the next Algorithm. 

### Algorithm 3: Leftmost Derivation Tree
- *Functions:*
  - leftmost_derivation(string): Constructs the leftmost derivation for an input string using the grammar \(G\).
  - print_derivation_tree(derivation): Prints the derivation steps with increasing indentation for clarity.
- *Main Function:*  
  Processes the accepted strings by the Algorithm 2, printing their derivation tree.

## Running the Implementation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
2. **Run the Desired Algorithm:**
  (Run ALGORITHM_1)
   ```bash
   python3 ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2025_JJE.py
   ```
   (Run ALGORITHM_2)
   ```bash
   python3 ALGORITHM_2_LFCO_2025_JJE.py
   ```
   (Run ALGORITHM_3)
   ```bash
   python3 ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2025_JJE.py
   ```

## Expected Output Examples

1. *Algorithm 1: String Generation*
   bash
      'ab'
      'aabb'
      'aaabbb'
      'aaaabbbb'
      'aaaaabbbbb'
      'aaaaaabbbbbb'
      'a'
      'b'
      'abbb'
      'aaabb'
      'aba'
      'ba'
      'aab'
      'bba'
   
2. *Algorithm 2: PDA Simulation*

For each test string, the output displays:

- Whether the string is accepted or rejected.
- A history of configurations (position, current symbol, and the current state of the stack).

3. *Algorithm 3: Leftmost Derivation Tree*

For a string like "aabb", the output will display:
    bash
    Leftmost derivation for string: 'aabb'
    S
      a S b
        a S b b
          a ε b b
